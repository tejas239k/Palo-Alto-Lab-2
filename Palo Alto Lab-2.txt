After that go to the management window and login PALO ALTO with new credentials

TAP INTERFACE
Tap interface is a passive listening mode in Palo Alto used to monitor network traffic without interfering/preventing with the live network flow.

Under Network 
select zones
add
Name: TAP
Type: Tap
press ok
next select interfaces
select the interface towards the Lan switch

LAN SWITCH
enable
configure terminal
monitor session 1 source interface gig0/0
monitor session 1 destination interface gig0/2

After that just go to the client machine and search for something and to monitor the traffic go to monitor in palo alto and then session browser.

V-WIRE
Virtual wire (vWire) is a deployment mode where two interfaces are logically bound together to function as a single, transparent "bump in the wire" without participating in Layer 2 or Layer 3 networking protocols like routing or switching.

vIOS(Internet facing router)
enable
configure terminal
